#### Overview

After completing the setup and configuration steps, we're ready to upload images to S3. We'll use the AWS SDK to create an API that handles the image upload process. To authenticate with AWS and upload images, we'll need the access key from the IAM user we created earlier. This access key provides the necessary credentials to interact with S3 and perform the upload operation.
Lets get started this section!
